## The journey

### How did I end up at Canva?

A bit of background. Canva had always been one of my dream companies for a few reasons:
* First, without even realising it until applying, I had been using Canva to create stunning infographic designs since year 10. I always knew of the product and loved using it, but it never registered that the product was named Canva, and that it was a major technology employer based in Australia.
* Second, a couple of Canva employees showed up at an uni club trivia night I attended during my first year. One question was: "where was Canva founded?" I blindly guessed Perth, and somehow got it right. Ever since then, I had been enamoured by Canva. Perhaps it was the inspiration that came with seeing an amazing product originating from own hometown.

So without hesitation, I took my shot and applied during my penultimate year. It was a longshot. I knew just how competitive it would be. Infact, I later found out that just 89 interns were taken from a pool of ~ 7000 applicants. But after an online assessment and a technical plus behavioural interview, I had made it in.

### Week 1 - Onboarding

Onboarding week swiftly came and went. We were taken through ample modules and setup the software necessary for our projects (e.g. Snowflake, GitHub, Accessing Data Warehouse). I also met my support team - including my host, co-host and buddy - who were all super smart & lovely people, and discussed my intern project with my host!

All the interns spent the first week from the comfort of their home (or closest office), which meant that I explored the amazing Melbourne office. A small, cosy and humble abode in the heart of Collingwood, the Melbourne office had delicious breakfast and lunched served up by the chefs, a friendly vibe team who greeted you every morning, great background music, free merch at the swag station and sick artwork fit for a design company.

### Week 2 - Campus week

Campus week was when the fun really began. All the interns were flown to Sydney and given accomodation for a week, which meant some of us (myself included) got to meet our team in person, there were plenty of intern activities planned and we capped off the week with the annual Canva end-of-year party!  

Let me tell you, this party was amazing. There was plenty of music (including a dance floor) to keep the vibes high, the street was decked out for us with food trucks, we attended stand-up comedy, learned how to shoot arrows and got to connect with one another while drunk. Actually, we could've gotten drunk anytime with beer taps and alcohol readily available on the Sydney office rooftop.  

I'm going to be completely transparent. I didn't get much work done this week. There were just too many intern events - both during and outside of work hours - that I didn't find the time to fully concentrate on my intern project. Fortunately, my team had told me to enjoy myself this week and not worry too much about work.
