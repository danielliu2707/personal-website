Hey! I'm Daniel – A data enthusiast and basketball fanatic. Whether I'm cooking up code or shooting hoops, I'm always looking to live my life to its fullest potential.  

Currently I'm in my third year of Computer Science and Commerce majoring in Data Science and Econometrics. My choice of degree led me to join the [Computing Commerce Association](https://www.ccamonash.com.au/) where I currently oversee the general vision and finances as the Treasurer of one of the largest student clubs at Monash University.  

Professionally, I'm always on the lookout for new experiences in the industry. I'm currently in the midst of a Data Science internship at [Newcrest](https://www.newcrest.com/), one of the largest gold/copper mining companies in the world 🌏. I'd like to further explore Data Science/Analytics to engage in my interest of making use of data through its analysis and machine learning models.

Through my website, I plan on posting about my experiences as I transition into the industry over the next few years which hopefully you (the reader) will find insightful. You can contact me through any of the attached links on my Resume.

See you in one of my blogs 😊.
