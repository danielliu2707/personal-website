Hey! I'm Daniel â€“ A data enthusiast and basketball fanatic.

I'm a fourth year Computer Science and Commerce student, majoring in Data Science and Business Analytics. This degree has led me to join the [Computing Commerce Association](https://www.ccamonash.com.au/), where I've held positions as the treasurer, marketing and sponsorship officer for one of the largest student clubs at Monash University.  

I'm also always looking to live life learning. That's why I sought real industry experience as a Data Science intern at Canva, an online design and communication platform. I'd love to continue exploring the many ways Data Science/Analytics is able to drive meaningful insights, and create a positive impact!

Through my website, I plan on posting about my experiences as I transition into the industry over the next few years which hopefully you (the reader) will find insightful. You can contact me through any of the attached links on my Resume.

See you in one of my blogs :)
